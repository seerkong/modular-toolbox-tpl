## 1. Design & Scaffolding
- [x] 1.1 Define shared router data shape and component resolution rules to support both Vue and React (suffix/extension strategy).
- [x] 1.2 Add mediator-level route resources and module route configs/contracts; update module exports to point to shared data.

## 2. Shell Integration
- [x] 2.1 Update Vue router builder/resources to consume mediator route data and resolve components with Vue extensions.
- [x] 2.2 Update React router builder/resources similarly for React extensions.
- [x] 2.3 Clean up shell module router/contract duplicates and adjust imports.

## 3. Verification
- [ ] 3.1 Update/add tests covering shared router data consumption for both shells.
- [ ] 3.2 Update docs or module scaffolding references; run lint/tests as available.
